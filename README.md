## User experience
While visiting my site, you can view which pets are currently up for adoption! Are you looking for a cat specifically? Click on the 'Cats' button to see the cats that can become a part of your family <3


## How magic was made
Pets cards were made possible by Javascript for loops. Filter buttons were made possible by eventlisteners to display certain pets.
